# Gimmick ROM extractor
This application allows extracting a raw NES ROM from the game files included with the Steam Release of GIMMICK! Special Edition

## Usage
1. Put Gimmick_ROM_extractor.exe into the same directory as AR_win32.mdf, which is the resource file that contains the ROM in an encrypted format.
For a default steam installation the path should look something like this: ```C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Gimmick! Special Edition\TRICK\```
2. Open Gimmick_ROM_extractor and you should be prompted if you want to extract the ROM from AR_win32.mdf. Hit y and after a second or so the ROM should be written to ```C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Gimmick! Special Edition\TRICK\RealGimmick.nes```
